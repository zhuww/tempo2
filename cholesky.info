MODEL	1							Reads a "old style" model file. Can be in the middle of a file.
MODEL	DM [D] [d] [f]				DM model with structure function [D] at a lag of [d] days. [f] must be set to 1400.
MODEL	T2							Indicates that we are reading a "new style" model file.
MODEL	T2PowerLaw [a] [P] [fc]		Power law model with corner frequency. index=[a], P(fc) = [P], fc=[fc].
DCF		[file]						Reads [file] as an "old old" style covariance function.
ECM             [file]                                          Reads [file] as an "extra" covariance matrix
MJD		[start] [end]				following lines are applied only to ToAs within this time period
PSR		[pulsar name]				following lines match only this pulsar
CLEAR	--							reset the PSR and MJD keywords
INCLUDE	[file]						Include this file. Note that MJD and PSR keywords are coppied into, but not out of, included files.
